# NLP-DataAnalysis
This project was done over a collection of data from twitter, The data is comments during the coronavirus quarantine, the goal 
was to try and label this data into (Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative) comments.

We used Natural Language Processing techniques such as (Normalization, Tokenization, Lemmatization and Stemming, Simplification, etc...), And 
were able to analyze the data, And got some new data on the relation between words used with which context, The reletion between the positivity of the comment 
and the country in which the user commented from and the collection of words used together.
